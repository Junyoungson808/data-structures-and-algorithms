# Tree Intersection
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Find similar nodes in two binary trees, using a function called tree_intersection. This function will take in two binary trees as arguments, and will return nodes that have the same values in both trees.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
tree_intersection:
Arguments: two Binary Trees
Return: set of values found in both trees.
